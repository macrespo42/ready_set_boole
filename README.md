# ready... set... boole! üèÅ

## An introduction project to boolean algebra and set theory

All the unit test for the project can be run with `cargo test`  
And you can run a little CLI programm to show test output with `cargo run`

Maximum time complexity: **O(1)**  
Maximum space complexity: **O(1)**  

You must write a function that takes as parameters two natural numbers a and b and re
turns one natural number that equals a + b. However the only operations you‚Äôre allowed
to use are:  

- & (bitwise AND)  
- | (bitwise OR)  
- ^ (bitwise XOR)  
- << (left shift)  
- \>\> (right shift)  
- = (assignment)  
- ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= (comparison operators)  

The incrementation operator (++ or += 1) is allowed only to increment the index of
a loop and must not be used to compute the result itself.
